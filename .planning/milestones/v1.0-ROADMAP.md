# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2025-12-30
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Build a structured content model for Payload CMS that enables composable landing pages with Hero, Content, and Footer sections containing reusable block types. Development happens in the dev app first, with extraction to plugin once patterns stabilize.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Create Page collection with three-section structure (Hero, Content, Footer) using Payload's array/block fields
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Page collection with three-section block architecture

**Details:**
- Created Page collection with title and slug fields
- Implemented three-section block architecture (hero, content, footer)
- Added placeholder blocks for each section
- Generated TypeScript types with proper block typing

---

### Phase 2: Block Types

**Goal**: Implement core block types: Hero (headline, subheadline, CTA, media), Accordion (expandable items)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Hero block with CTA group and Accordion block

**Details:**
- Replaced placeholder heroBlock with complete implementation
- Hero includes: headline (required), subheadline, CTA group (ctaText, ctaLink), media upload
- Added accordionBlock to content section with items array (title + richText content)
- Used group field for CTA to organize related fields

---

### Phase 3: Reusable Blocks

**Goal**: Create reusable blocks library collection and reference field to link pages to library blocks
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: ReusableBlocks collection with block reference field

**Details:**
- Created ReusableBlocks collection with title, blockType selector, polymorphic block field
- Added reusableBlockRef block to Page content section
- Type generation produces proper union types for block references

---

### Phase 4: Integration

**Goal**: Generate TypeScript types for all new collections/fields and add integration tests
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Integration tests for Pages and ReusableBlocks

**Details:**
- 3 Pages collection tests: hero block creation, content blocks creation, unique slug validation
- 3 ReusableBlocks tests: creation, page reference, populated query with depth:1
- All 9 integration tests pass (3 original + 6 new)

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Section-based pages vs flexible layout: Provides structure while allowing content flexibility within sections (Good)
- Inline + library blocks (hybrid): Balance between simplicity (inline) and reusability (library) (Good)
- Build in dev app first: Faster iteration, extract to plugin when patterns stabilize (Good)
- CTA as group field: Organize related CTA fields, improve admin UX (Good)

**Issues Resolved:**

- None encountered during this milestone

**Issues Deferred:**

- FAQ block type with question/answer pairs (to v1.1)
- Stats block type with numeric values, labels, and optional icons (to v1.1)
- Plugin extraction from dev app (to future milestone)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Pre-existing test infrastructure issues noted:
  - `payload.destroy is not a function` in afterAll hook
  - Playwright e2e.spec.ts configuration issue
