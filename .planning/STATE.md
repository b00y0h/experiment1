## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Section-based pages: Good — clear separation of hero/content/footer
- Hybrid blocks: Good — ReusableBlocks collection works well
- Dev app first: Good — pattern validated, ready for extraction
- nanoid(12) for blockIds: Compact, URL-safe, collision-resistant stable IDs

### Deferred Issues

- Plugin extraction (future) — after v2.0 patterns stabilize

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Roadmap Evolution

- Milestone v2.0 created: Page assembly + variant ready, 5 phases (Phase 5-9)
